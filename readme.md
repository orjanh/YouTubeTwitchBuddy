## YouTube/Twitch Buddy

Small WPF app for showing a combined list of all your favorite YouTube and Twitch channels.

I made this because I wanted to have a single list containing all the latest videos of the YouTube and Twitch channels I was following.

### Getting started

Insert YouTube and/or Twitch channel names in the respective textboxes. Separate channels with '|' (pipe).

Let's say you wish to view all videos by Microsoft (https://www.youtube.com/user/Microsoft) and Apple (https://www.youtube.com/user/Apple).
The channel name is the last part of the URL. The same goes for Twitch channels (e.g. http://www.twitch.tv/microsoft/):

Example: Microsoft|Apple
